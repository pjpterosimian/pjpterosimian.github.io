    <h2>About PJ</h2>
    <p class="lead">I am interested in the far distant past and the far distant future, in the macro-scale and the micro-scale, in personality, communication, expression, movement, anatomy, speciation, habitat, erosion, tectonics, terraforming, astronomy, simulation, analogies, and the great study of the human organism that is video game design.
    I value learning, innocence, and the reduction of messy real-world complexity into tidy units of cuteness and fun.</p>
